# 🚀 MageFlow Roadmap

> Building the future of intelligent task orchestration, one feature at a time.

## 📋 Task Lifecycle Management

Complete control over task state, persistence, and recovery throughout their execution lifecycle.

### 🗑️ Delayed Signature Deletion
> **Difficulty:** `HARD` | **Priority:** `HIGH` | **Status:** `Planned`

Implement delayed deletion system for task signatures to enable rerun capabilities.

**What's Coming:**
- ⏰ **Delayed Deletion** - Mark signatures for deletion after configurable time period
- 🔄 **Rerun Window** - Allow users to rerun signatures before permanent deletion
- 🏷️ **Soft Delete** - Mark signatures as deleted while preserving data temporarily
- 🧹 **Cleanup Jobs** - Background processes to permanently remove expired signatures
- ⚙️ **Configurable TTL** - Adjustable time-to-live for deleted signatures
- 📊 **Status Tracking** - New `MARKED_FOR_DELETION` status with expiration timestamps

**Critical Requirement:**
> **Note:** Tasks with signatures must continue to run even if the signature was marked for deletion. Active execution should not be affected by the deletion process.

**Technical Challenges:**
- 🔐 **Reference Integrity** - Maintain task execution while signature is in deletion queue
- 🕒 **Time Management** - Handle timezone-aware deletion scheduling
- 💾 **Storage Optimization** - Balance rerun capability with storage efficiency
- 🔄 **Race Conditions** - Prevent conflicts between deletion and rerun operations

**Impact:** Enable safe signature management with recovery options, reducing accidental data loss while maintaining system performance.

### 🧹 Signature Cleanup Callbacks
> **Difficulty:** `MEDIUM` | **Priority:** `HIGH` | **Status:** `Planned`

Implement cleanup callbacks for each signature that execute on both success and failure to ensure proper resource management.

**What's Coming:**
- ✅ **Success Cleanup** - Execute cleanup operations after successful task completion
- ❌ **Failure Cleanup** - Trigger cleanup on task failures or errors
- 🔄 **Guaranteed Execution** - Ensure cleanup runs regardless of task outcome
- 🎯 **Per-Signature Config** - Configure cleanup callbacks at signature level
- 🧹 **Resource Management** - Properly release resources, close connections, clean temporary files
- 📊 **Cleanup Tracking** - Monitor and log cleanup operations for debugging

**Use Cases:**
- Database connection cleanup after query execution
- Temporary file removal after processing
- Lock release in distributed systems
- Resource deallocation and memory cleanup
- External API session termination
- Notification sending after task completion

**Technical Implementation:**
- Cleanup callbacks execute in finally-like semantics
- Support both synchronous and asynchronous cleanup functions
- Chain cleanup callbacks for nested operations
- Handle cleanup callback failures gracefully

**Impact:** Ensure robust resource management and prevent resource leaks by guaranteeing cleanup operations execute regardless of task success or failure.

---

### ⛔ Support Interrupt Tasks
> **Difficulty:** `MEDIUM` | **Priority:** `HIGH` | **Status:** `Planned`

Implement the missing interrupt functionality for aggressive task termination.

**What's Coming:**
- 🛑 **Aggressive Termination** - Force stop tasks regardless of execution status
- 🔄 **All Task Types** - Support interrupt for signatures, chains, and swarms
- ⚠️ **State Management** - Handle interrupted task state transitions
- 🔧 **Recovery Logic** - Implement best-effort resume for interrupted tasks
- 📊 **Status Tracking** - Proper `INTERRUPTED` status handling
- 🛡️ **Error Handling** - Graceful handling of interrupt failures

**Current Status:**
- ❌ Method exists in API but raises `NotImplementedError`
- ❌ Task lifecycle documentation exists but functionality missing
- ❌ Chain and swarm interrupt operations not functional

**Impact:** Complete the task lifecycle management system with aggressive task termination capabilities, enabling better control over runaway or stuck tasks.

---

### 🚫 Cancel Tasks (Complete Deletion)
> **Difficulty:** `MEDIUM` | **Priority:** `MEDIUM` | **Status:** `Planned`

Implement task cancellation that completely removes the signature, unlike interrupt which preserves it.

**What's Coming:**
- 🗑️ **Immediate Deletion** - Completely remove task signature from system
- 🛑 **Force Stop + Delete** - Stop execution and permanently delete all data
- 🔄 **All Task Types** - Support cancellation for signatures, chains, and swarms
- 🧹 **Cleanup Operations** - Remove all associated callbacks, logs, and metadata
- ⚠️ **Confirmation System** - Require explicit confirmation for destructive operation
- 📊 **Audit Trail** - Log cancellation events for debugging and compliance

**Key Differences from Interrupt:**

```
┌─────────────┬───────────┬─────────────┬──────────────┐
│  Operation  │ Execution │  Signature  │   Recovery   │
├─────────────┼───────────┼─────────────┼──────────────┤
│ Interrupt   │ ⏹️ Stops   │ ✅ Preserved │ 🔄 Possible  │
│ Cancel      │ ⏹️ Stops   │ ❌ Deleted   │ ❌ Impossible │
└─────────────┴───────────┴─────────────┴──────────────┘
```

**Use Cases:**
- Permanent removal of erroneous task submissions
- Cleanup of test/development tasks
- Resource cleanup when tasks are no longer needed
- Emergency deletion of problematic workflows

**Impact:** Provide complete task lifecycle control with permanent removal capabilities for situations where tasks should never be resumed or recovered.

---

### 🔄 Auto-Resume Unfinished Tasks
> **Difficulty:** `HARD` | **Priority:** `HIGH` | **Status:** `Planned`

- 💥 **Unexpected Crash** - System failure during task execution  
- 🔌 **Network Issues** - Connection loss during distributed execution
- 🔧 **Maintenance** - Planned restarts during maintenance windows

**Task State Handling:**

```
┌───────────┬──────────┬─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Status   │  Action  │            Behavior             │
├───────────┼──────────┼─────────────────────────────────┤
│ RUNNING   │ ▶️ Resume │ Continue from last checkpoint   │
│ PENDING   │ 🚀 Start  │ Begin execution normally        │
│ SUSPENDED │ ⏸️ Keep   │ Maintain suspended state        │
│ FAILED    │ ❌ Skip   │ Don't auto-resume failed tasks  │
└───────────┴──────────┴─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Configuration:**
- 🎛️ **Global toggle** for auto-resume functionality
- 🏷️ **Task-type filters** to control which types resume
- ⏱️ **Delay settings** to stagger resume operations
- 🔍 **Validation rules** for safe resumption

**Impact:** Provide seamless task continuity across worker restarts, ensuring no work is lost during planned or unplanned downtime.

**Current vs Proposed:**
```python
# Current approach (inefficient)
for task in task_list:
    await swarm.add_task(task)
await swarm.run()

# Proposed approach (efficient)
await swarm.add_tasks_bulk(task_list)

# Single task add-and-run (new)
await swarm.add_task_and_run(task)

await swarm.add_tasks_and_run(task_list)
```

**Features:**
- 🎛️ **Configurable batch size** to prevent memory issues

### 🏗️ Complex Task Signatures
> **Difficulty:** `VERY HARD` | **Priority:** `HIGH` | **Status:** `Planned`

Create special task type that can define complex workflows instead of simple tasks.

**What's Coming:**
- 🧩 **Composite Signatures** - Signatures that contain entire workflows (swarms, chains, graphs)
- 🎯 **Unified Callbacks** - Execute callbacks only when the entire complex task completes
- 🔄 **Nested Workflows** - Allow swarms to contain complex signatures that are themselves swarms/chains
- 📊 **Hierarchical Status** - Track status of both the wrapper signature and internal workflow
- 🎮 **Unified Control** - Treat complex workflows as single units for lifecycle operations
- 📋 **Metadata Aggregation** - Collect and aggregate results from all internal tasks

**Use Cases:**
- **Swarm of Workflows**: Put a chain signature in a swarm that executes when the entire chain completes
- **Nested Processing**: Create signatures that represent multi-stage data processing pipelines
- **Conditional Workflows**: Embed graph tasks as signatures within other orchestration patterns
- **Reusable Components**: Package complex workflows as reusable signature units

**Technical Architecture:**
```
Signature (Complex Type)
├── Internal Workflow (Chain/Swarm/Graph)
│   ├── Task 1 → Task 2 → Task 3
│   └── Callbacks execute only on internal completion
└── External Callbacks (execute on signature completion)
```

**Callback Behavior:**
- ✅ **Internal callbacks** fire during internal workflow execution
- 🎯 **External callbacks** fire only when entire complex signature completes
- 🔄 **Error propagation** from internal workflows to signature level

**Impact:** Enable true composition of orchestration patterns, allowing users to build sophisticated nested workflows with proper callback semantics and lifecycle management.
